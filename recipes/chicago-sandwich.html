    <p>A Chicago Italian beef sandwich is composed of thin slices of seasoned roast beef, slow-roasted and simmered for hours in a spicy au jus. The meat is served on a long, soft, yet sturdy roll and dipped (or double-dipped) into the broth</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 ½ pounds boneless beef chuck, cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
      <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
      <li>6 cloves garlic, sliced</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons white vinegar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon dried oregano</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried rosemary</li>

     <h3>Steps</h3>
     <ol> 
        <li>Season beef with a pinch of salt and black pepper. Heat vegetable oil in a heavy pot over high heat. Cook and stir beef in hot oil until browned, 5 to 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir garlic, vinegar, oregano, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, thyme, rosemary, 1 teaspoon black pepper, bay leaf, and red pepper flakes into beef. Pour enough chicken broth into beef mixture to cover the meat by 1 inch and bring to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Cover pot with a lid, reduce heat to low, and simmer until meat is fork-tender, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.</li>
        <li>Transfer meat with a strainer or slotted spoon to a separate pot; pour about 1/4 cup of meat broth into pot. Use a wooden spoon to gently break meat into smaller chunks. Cover pot with a lid or aluminum foil and keep warm.</li>
        <li>Skim excess grease from top of broth remaining in the first pot; season with salt and pepper to taste. Cover pot with a lid or aluminum foil and keep broth warm.</li>
        <li>Lay halves of a roll out on a work surface and spoon 2 to 3 tablespoons meat broth over each half. Top bottom half of roll with a generous portion of meat and a spoonful of pickled vegetables. Place tops on sandwich. Repeat with remaining buns, broth, meat, and pickled vegetables to make 3 more sandwiches.</li>
        <li>Spoon hot meat broth into ramekins and top each ramekin with 1/2 teaspoon parsley. Serve sandwiches with hot broth for dipping.</li>
     </ol>
